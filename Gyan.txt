P/E ->
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio relates a company's share price to its earnings per share.
A high P/E ratio could mean that a company's stock is overvalued, or that investors are expecting high growth rates in the future.
A high P/E could mean that a stock's price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. Conversely, a low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to earnings. 
When a company has no earnings or is posting losses, in both cases, the P/E will be expressed as N/A. 
The higher the ratio, the more expensive a stock is relative to its earnings. The lower the ratio, the less expensive the stock.
